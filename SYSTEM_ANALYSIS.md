## ü§ñ **Machine Learning Model Architecture**

### **Model Type**: Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Target**: Predict `total_runs` for over/under betting

### **Feature Engineering Pipeline**

#### **1. Pitcher Performance Metrics**

```python
# Calculated ERA for each pitcher based on historical performance
pitcher_era = (earned_runs * 9) / innings_pitched

# Pitcher effectiveness indicators
k_bb_ratio = strikeouts / walks  # Control indicator
whip = (hits + walks) / innings_pitched  # Baserunner frequency
```

#### **2. Weather Impact Factors**

```python
# Wind impact on scoring
wind_boost = wind_speed * wind_direction_multiplier
# Temperature effect on ball flight
temp_factor = (temperature - 70) * 0.01  # Warmer = more offense

# Weather scoring adjustment
weather_impact = wind_boost + temp_factor
```

#### **3. Ballpark Factors**

```python
# Venue-specific scoring tendencies
park_factor = venue_run_environment[venue_id]
# Day vs night game adjustments
time_factor = 0.2 if day_night == "N" else 0.0  # Night games typically higher scoring
```

#### **4. Team Offensive Metrics**

```python
# Recent team performance
team_offensive_rating = (recent_runs + recent_hits + recent_rbi) / games_played
# Left-on-base efficiency (clutch hitting)
clutch_factor = 1 - (lob / (hits + walks))
```

### **Model Training Features**

**Input Features** (~20 engineered features):

1. **Pitcher Quality**: ERA, K/BB ratio, WHIP, recent form
2. **Weather Factors**: Temperature, wind speed/direction impact
3. **Ballpark Effects**: Venue factors, day/night adjustments
4. **Team Offense**: Batting averages, RBI efficiency, clutch metrics
5. **Game Context**: Season timing, series position, rest days

**Training Process**:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Feature engineering pipeline
features = engineer_features(enhanced_dataset)

# Train/test split (80/20)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, total_runs, test_size=0.2)

# Model training
model = GradientBoostingRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=6,
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
