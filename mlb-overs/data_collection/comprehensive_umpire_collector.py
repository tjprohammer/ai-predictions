"""
Comprehensive Umpire Assignment Collector for Historic Games

This script populates umpire assignments for all 2,002 games using multiple approaches:
1. Try real data from Sportradar API (limited by quotas)
2. Web scrape Baseball Reference for complete coverage
3. Fall back to realistic MLB rotation simulation

Follows actual MLB umpire crew rotation patterns and schedules.
