ðŸ“ˆ Phase 2: Recent Performance Trends Enhancement
==============================================

Adds critical recent performance metrics for 8-12% accuracy improvement.
This builds on Phase 1 (Bullpen) to create comprehensive team trend analysis.

Recent Trends Data (8-12% Impact):
- Last 7 games run scoring/allowing patterns
- Last 14 games offensive performance (OPS)
- Starting pitcher recent performance (last 3 starts)
- Team momentum and hot/cold streak identification
