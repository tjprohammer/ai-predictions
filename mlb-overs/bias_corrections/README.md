- **`model_bias_corrections_active.json`** - Copy of current active bias corrections

## üîç Investigation Summary

**Problem Identified:**

- Original model trained on 170 sophisticated features
- Current pipeline only generated ~125 basic features
- Missing ~45+ critical features caused impossibly low raw predictions (~3.5 runs)
- Heavy bias corrections (+3.0 global adjustment) were masking fundamental model issues

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Retrained model** with current 125-feature set using `train_clean_model.py`
2. **Reset bias corrections** to minimal values (global_adjustment: 0.0)
3. **Validated realistic predictions** (7.0-8.5 runs vs 3.5 runs before)
4. **Deployed to production** with proper calibration

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ Predictions now in realistic MLB range (7.0-8.5 runs)
- ‚úÖ Average difference from market: ~1.0 run (vs 2.8 runs before)
- ‚úÖ Eliminated "every single prediction is under" systematic bias
- ‚úÖ Model properly calibrated to current data pipeline

## üöÄ Usage

To re-run any of these analyses or tests:

```

## üìÖ Timeline

**August 20, 2025:**

- Morning: Identified systematic under-prediction issue
- Investigation: Discovered feature mismatch between model and pipeline
- Solution: Retrained model with current feature set
