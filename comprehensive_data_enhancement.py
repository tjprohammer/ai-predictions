Comprehensive Data Enhancement Strategy
======================================

This script will:
1. Backfill missing team offensive data for the entire season
2. Create team vs totals historical performance analysis
3. Add recent team trends (last 5, 10, 15 games)
4. Calculate team-specific over/under tendencies
5. Enhance prediction logic with historical validation
