Team Handedness & Recency Patch
===============================

This module adds team vs pitcher handedness rolling statistics and lineup composition
to the enhanced_games table. Implements Empirical Bayes blending for proper statistical
inference on short-term performance windows.

Key enhancements:
- Team wRC+ vs RHP/LHP for 7/14/30 day rolling windows  
- Lineup R/L composition percentages
- Bullpen quality proxies (ERA by window)
- Empirical Bayes shrinkage for combining short/long-term stats

This integrates with the enhanced database schema from migrations/20250828_recency_matchup.sql
