# Recency & Matchup Features Implementation
## Complete Patch Set for Enhanced Baseball Analytics

### Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of advanced baseball-specific features for the Ultra-80 incremental learning system. The patch set addresses the identified gaps in pitcher vs team history, handedness splits, last start performance, and implements Empirical Bayes blending for proper statistical inference.

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

The existing incremental learning system was missing critical baseball-specific features:

1. **Pitcher Last Start Performance**: No visibility into recent pitcher form, days rest, or workload
2. **Team vs Handedness Splits**: No differentiation between team performance vs RHP/LHP  
3. **Lineup Composition**: No tracking of R/L batter splits in lineups
4. **Bullpen Quality**: No proxy metrics for relief pitcher strength
5. **Statistical Rigor**: No proper shrinkage for combining short/long-term statistics

These gaps meant the system couldn't capture important baseball dynamics like:
- A pitcher coming off a poor outing or high pitch count
- Teams that crush left-handed pitching but struggle vs righties  
- Bullpen advantages in close games
- Proper statistical inference on small samples

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

The solution implements a comprehensive feature enhancement pipeline:

```
Database Schema (enhanced_games)
├── Pitcher Features (8 new columns)
│   ├── Last start runs allowed (home/away)
│   ├── Last start pitch count (home/away) 
│   ├── Days rest since last start (home/away)
│   └── Pitcher handedness (home/away)
│
├── Team vs Handedness Features (12 new columns)

└── Bullpen Quality (6 new columns)
    └── ERA by rolling windows (7d/14d/30d, home/away)
```

## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive**

### **Empirical Bayes Implementation**

The core mathematical insight is proper shrinkage for small samples:

```
θ = (k*μ + n*x̄) / (k + n)

Where:
- θ = Blended estimate
- k = Shrinkage parameter (60-80 for baseball)
- μ = Long-term prior (30-day performance)  
- n = Sample size (7 days = ~7 games)
- x̄ = Short-term sample mean

Example:
- Team has 140 wRC+ vs RHP in last 7 days (hot streak)
- Team has 105 wRC+ vs RHP in last 30 days (seasonal)
- Blended: (60*105 + 7*140) / (60+7) = 109.6 wRC+
```

This prevents over-weighting small samples while maintaining responsiveness to real changes.

### **Feature Engineering Pipeline**

1. **Data Collection**:
   ```python
   # Pitcher last start from MLB API
   last_start = get_pitcher_game_log(pitcher_id, reference_date)
   
   # Team splits calculation
   team_splits = calculate_rolling_splits(team_id, windows=[7,14,30])
   ```

2. **Statistical Processing**:
   ```python
   # Apply Empirical Bayes blending
   blended_wrc = empirical_bayes_blend(
       short_term=wrc_7d,
       long_term=wrc_30d, 
       shrinkage_k=60
   )
   ```

3. **Database Storage**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE enhanced_games SET
       team_wrc_plus_vs_rhp_blended_home = :blended_wrc,
       pitcher_days_rest_home = :days_rest
   WHERE game_id = :game_id
   ```

4. **Feature Serving**:
   ```python
   # Served to incremental learning system
   enhanced_df = attach_recency_and_matchup_features(df, engine, date)
   predictions = incremental_system.predict(enhanced_df)
   ```
