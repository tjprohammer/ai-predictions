# MLB Learning Loop Implementation Complete

## üéØ Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive machine learning learning loop for MLB over/under predictions that includes:

1. **Daily Evaluation**: Automatic assessment of model performance vs actual game outcomes
2. **Automated Retraining**: Rolling window retraining with time-decay weights and holdout validation
3. **Bundle Provenance**: Complete tracking of model versions, training data, and performance metrics
4. **Prediction Coverage**: Validation that predictions are generated for all scheduled games

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

### 1. Daily API Workflow (`mlb-overs/deployment/daily_api_workflow.py`)

**Main orchestration pipeline** that coordinates all stages:

- **Markets Stage**: Fetch fresh external data (odds, pitchers, team stats, weather)
- **Features Stage**: Engineer prediction features from collected data
- **Predict Stage**: Generate predictions with bundle provenance logging
- **Evaluation Stage**: Calculate model performance vs actual outcomes
- **Retraining Stage**: Automated model improvement

**Key Functions:**

- `stage_eval()`: Daily performance evaluation with MAE, bias, calibration metrics
- `stage_retrain()`: Wrapper for automated retraining pipeline
- `log_bundle_provenance()`: Track model metadata and performance
- `assert_predictions_written()`: Validate prediction coverage

### 2. Automated Retraining (`mlb-overs/deployment/retrain_model.py`)

**Production-ready retraining script** with:

- **Rolling Window**: 150-day training window with 21-day holdout
- **Time Decay Weights**: Recent games weighted higher (60-day half-life)
- **Feature Engineering**: Full feature parity with serving pipeline
- **Validation**: Holdout evaluation with market baseline comparison
- **Atomic Deployment**: Safe model swapping with bundle metadata
- **Audit Integration**: Optional validation checks before deployment

**Key Features:**

- Configurable training windows and model parameters
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (MAE, bias, market comparison)
- Reference statistics for production monitoring
- Schema versioning and metadata tracking

### 3. Data Pipeline Integration

**Fresh external data** flowing through:

- **ESPN Odds**: Live betting totals via `working_espn_odds_ingestor.py`
- **MLB Stats API**: Pitcher season stats (ERA, WHIP, K, BB, IP) via `working_pitcher_ingestor.py`
- **Team Statistics**: Season batting averages via `working_team_ingestor.py`
- **Weather Data**: Game conditions via `working_weather_ingestor.py`

**Database Schema Enhanced:**

```sql
-- New columns added to enhanced_games
home_sp_whip, away_sp_whip           -- Real WHIP values (1.03-1.89 range)
home_team_avg, away_team_avg         -- Real batting averages (0.228-0.268)
home_sp_season_k, away_sp_season_k   -- Season strikeouts (31-95 range)
home_sp_season_bb, away_sp_season_bb -- Season walks (16-42 range)
home_sp_season_ip, away_sp_season_ip -- Season innings (30.2-101.1)
```

### 4. Evaluation Storage (`model_eval_daily` table)

**Daily performance tracking** with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE model_eval_daily (
    eval_date DATE PRIMARY KEY,
    model_version TEXT,
    n_games INTEGER,
    mae_model FLOAT,
    mae_market FLOAT,
    bias_model FLOAT,
    bias_market FLOAT,
    r2_score FLOAT,
    market_beat_rate FLOAT,
    model_sha TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Daily Prediction Pipeline

```bash
# Full daily pipeline (data + predictions + evaluation)
python mlb-overs/deployment/daily_api_workflow.py markets features predict eval

# Yesterday's evaluation only
python mlb-overs/deployment/daily_api_workflow.py eval

# Automated retraining
python mlb-overs/deployment/daily_api_workflow.py retrain
```

### Manual Retraining

```bash
# Standard retraining with deployment
python mlb-overs/deployment/retrain_model.py --end 2025-08-15 --deploy --audit

# Custom parameters
python mlb-overs/deployment/retrain_model.py \
    --window-days 200 \
    --holdout-days 30 \
    --n-estimators 800 \
    --deploy
```

### Testing Learning Loop

```bash
# Test evaluation and retraining components
python test_learning_loop.py
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Real Data Validation

‚úÖ **WHIP Values**: 1.03, 1.26, 1.34, 1.89 (realistic spread)  
‚úÖ **Batting Averages**: 0.228, 0.245, 0.252, 0.268 (season variation)  
‚úÖ **Pitcher Stats**: K: 31-95, BB: 16-42, IP: 30.2-101.1 (real ranges)

### Bundle Provenance Example

```json
{
  "model_version": "rf_20250815_143022",
  "training_date": "2025-08-15T14:30:22",
  "feature_count": 47,
  "feature_sha": "abc123...",
  "evaluation_metrics": {
    "mae_train": 0.852,
    "mae_holdout": 0.891,
    "mae_market_holdout": 0.925
  }
}
```

### Daily Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Model vs actual total runs
- **Market Comparison**: Model performance vs betting market
- **Bias Measurement**: Over/under prediction tendency
- **Calibration**: Prediction accuracy across different game types
- **Coverage**: Percentage of games with predictions

## üîÑ Learning Loop Workflow

1. **Daily 6 AM**: Collect fresh external data (odds, pitchers, teams, weather)
2. **Daily 7 AM**: Generate predictions for today's games with bundle logging
3. **Daily 8 AM**: Evaluate yesterday's predictions vs actual outcomes
4. **Weekly Sunday**: Automated retraining with 150-day rolling window
5. **Continuous**: Monitor prediction coverage and data quality

## üéØ Production Benefits

1. **Automated Learning**: Model improves continuously from new game outcomes
2. **Performance Tracking**: Daily evaluation metrics stored for monitoring
3. **Fresh Data**: Real-time integration with MLB Stats API and ESPN odds
4. **Model Provenance**: Complete audit trail of training data and performance
5. **Atomic Deployment**: Safe model updates without service interruption
6. **Quality Assurance**: Prediction coverage validation and holdout evaluation

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
