Real Data Feature Fixer - Uses Only Actual MLB Data
===================================================

This script fixes critical features using ONLY real data sources:
- Real game scores for team performance calculations
- Real market totals and odds for betting insights
- Real pitcher names for player-specific statistics  
- Real umpire names for official tendencies
- Real ballpark names for venue factors

No simulated or fake data used.
