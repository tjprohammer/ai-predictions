## How the Learning Model Works

### 1. **Data Collection & Feature Engineering**

```python
# 207 total features processed through comprehensive pipeline
Features Include:
- Player Stats: ERA, WHIP, OPS, recent performance
- Team Stats: Bullpen strength, offensive metrics
- Environmental: Weather, venue factors, umpire tendencies
- Market: Odds, totals, public sentiment
- Advanced: xwOBA, FIP, situational matchups
```

### 2. **Learning Model Training Process**

```python
# Key characteristics of legitimate model:
- Uses only pre-game information (no actual scores)
- 203 carefully selected features
- RandomForestRegressor with optimized hyperparameters
- Trained on 60+ days of historical data
- Strict train/validation split to prevent overfitting
```

### 3. **Dual Prediction Generation**

```python
# Both models generate predictions for each game:
{
    "original_prediction": 8.75,
    "learning_prediction": 8.92,
    "prediction_difference": 0.17,
    "consensus": "over",
    "confidence": 0.78
}
```

python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

cd "s:\Projects\AI_Predictions\mlb-overs\deployment"; python daily_api_workflow.py --date 2025-08-24 --stages markets,features,predict,odds,health,prob,export,audit

not sure why we are now only using 37 feature. why can we not be consistant with our features. also this is very important: how do we make sure when our workflow runs it uses the original moel and the learning model for predictions but seperate the completed games from this. clearly the models need the completed games for adpating. our bat file makes sure new data is injected. the predictors uses that data and builds a few features, looks at recent predictions and completed games and send a prediction. when we run the bat file at the end of the day we should flag for completed games to get the results of its predictions and repeat that process for tomorrow and the next day and the next day? did i explain that right? 

also this files are great but the clean_learning model i think is just not enought to make good predictions: 
retrain_model.py - Main production model trainer
train_fixed_model.py - Fixed model trainer
retrain_learning_model.py - Learning model retrainer
create_clean_learning_model.py - Clean model trainer (new)
